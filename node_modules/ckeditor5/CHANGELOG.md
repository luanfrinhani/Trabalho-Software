## [12.3.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v12.3.0...v12.3.1) (2019-07-10)

We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v12.3.0 (and v12.3.1 with a [small fix](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-typing/pull/209)). This release introduces several new features ([word count](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/word-count.html), [automatic text transformations](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/text-transformation.html), [ability to control link attributes such as `target`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/link.html#custom-link-attributes-decorators) and [block indentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/indent.html)). It also brings improvements to existing features (e.g. the ["document colors" section](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/font.html#documents-colors) in the font color picker dropdowns) and many bug fixes.

## [12.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v11.2.0...v12.0.0) (2019-02-28)

We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v12.0.0. This release introduces a new editor (called "[Balloon block editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/examples/builds/balloon-block-editor.html)"), the [editor content placeholder](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/editor-placeholder.html) and support for inline widgets (watch [this PR](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/pull/1587) for updates). In addition to that we enabled media embeds and images in tables and resolved the issue where `editor.getData()` returned `<p>&nbsp;</p>` for empty content (now it returns an empty string in this case).

Besides new features, this release contains many improvements to stability, [performance](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils/issues/269) and API. The last group of changes contain many breaking ones. Make sure to read the notes below.

Read more in the blog post: https://ckeditor.com/blog/CKEditor-5-v12.0.0-with-inline-widgets-and-distraction-free-editor-released/

**Important information for integration developers:** The `editor.getData()` method will return an empty string if the editor is empty (instead of returning `<p>&nbsp;</p>`). Also, if you relied on `editor.ui.view.editable`, you will now need to use `editor.ui.getEditableElement()` instead. You may also want to read the below sections and the [Migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1582) to learn more.

**Important information for plugin developers:** The most important change that will affect your plugins is the removal of the `upcast-converters.js` and `downcast-converters.js` modules. You can now find those methods directly on the object returned by [`editor.conversion.for()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_conversion_conversion-Conversion.html#function-for). Other than that, see the changes described in the next section, the [engine's changelog](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine/releases/tag/v13.0.0) and read the [Migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1582) for the details.

**Important information for custom editor developers:** We cleaned up the base editor interfaces and classes (`EditorWithUI`, `EditorUI`, `EditorUIView`, `EditableUIView`) and straightened responsibilities between the UI and the engine (the engine is now the one responsible for managing editable element classes). These changes means that your custom editor implementations will need to be updated. Read more in the [Migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1582).

### Release notes

This is a major releases that introduces two new plugins ([autosave](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/saving-data.html) and [block toolbar](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/blocktoolbar.html)), many smaller features, dozens of bug fixes and a couple of infrastructure changes (an upgrade to `webpack@4` and simplified structure of build repositories).

### Features

Besides new features introduced by the dependencies, this version also introduces the following features:

### Other changes

* Updated `webpack` to version 4. ([7390460](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/7390460))

### BREAKING CHANGES

If you maintain a custom build or integrate CKEditor 5 from source, we recommend reading the [migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1136). Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#1038](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1038).

* CKEditor 5 environment was updated to use `webpack@4`. `webpack@4` introduced major changes in its configuration and plugin system. CKEditor 5 tools and build configuration were updated to work with `webpack@4` and will not work with `webpack@3`.
* The structure of build repositories was changed. The `build-config.js` files were removed and the build configuration is now kept only in the `src/ckeditor.js` files.

## [1.0.0-beta.4](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v1.0.0-beta.2...v1.0.0-beta.4) (2018-04-19)

### Release notes

This is a minor release that mainly focuses on stabilizing the [two-step caret movement around links](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/whats-new.html#caret-movement-around-links).

A breaking change was introduced in the [document editor build](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/overview.html#document-editor) – refer to its [changelog](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.4) for more information.

Finally, two new plugins were introduced – [`ParagraphButtonUI`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_paragraph_paragraphbuttonui-ParagraphButtonUI.html) and [`HeadingButtonsUI`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_heading_headingbuttonsui-HeadingButtonsUI.html) which make it possible to replace the `headings` dropdown with separate buttons for each heading level.

PS. The `1.0.0-beta.3` version number was skipped in order to align the project version number which diverged from builds version numbers
